L-1B Pre-Screening Document

L-1B petitions are highly scrutinized; accordingly, it is necessary to develop a strong case for specialized knowledge outlined in a narrative support letter and bolstered by any documentary evidence (if available/applicable). This will increase the chances of a successful blanket visa application.

Specialized Knowledge is defined as follows:

Special knowledge of the employer’s product, service, research, equipment, techniques, management, or other interests.  

Harish has expertise on Harmony application functional knowledge and its associated backed applications made him a Subject Matter Expert for the Harmony Project from testing standpoint and also uniquely qualified to contribute on Automation technologies like Selenium, ATDD, SoapUI and Jenkins. Harish played the pivotal role in delivering the complex business critical projects with utmost quality. Harish is the only resource who worked on Harmony Functional, API, Mobile, ETL and End to End Testing (Interaction with all the backend systems like FISERV, CAMS and WEX) program for more than 24 months where others have minimal knowledge on all the deliverables. Harish is working on Harmony application and which is financial highway and to work on application like that you need both expert in technologies and application knowledge because one issue can cause thousands/million dollars loss to company. It will be really hard to find Harish’s match in given scenarios and given time line.

Advanced knowledge/expertise in the organization’s specific processes and procedures that is greatly developed or further along in progress, complexity, and understanding than that generally found within UHG/Optum.

Harish onshore presence is required to test the ETL testing which cannot be run at offshore. This project will require strong knowledge on Health care domain knowledge along with the understanding of backend application with prior knowledge of End to End testing. This 3 combination of knowledge makes it very rare skill in market.  More over the skills are niche in nature and require in-depth knowledge of application along with strong US health care domain knowledge. At this instance, there is no possibility of identifying such resource in the market who can replace Harish for this program.

Optum Wallet program is launching initially for Walgreens client. This program is to enable the Walgreens customers to access their Reward cards online using our Harmony Portal. As experienced professional, Harish has good application knowledge and understanding on all the interfaces and its backed applications that cannot be easily transferred to another individual in a short period of time. Training another employee would take significant amount of time (6 months followed by 12 to 18 months of hand on experience), but Optum Wallet project could not hold on for such a longer time.

c.	What is the business reason for the transfer of this candidate to the US?

He is the only member of his team who possesses 10+ years of experience and an in depth understanding of all the applications and its backend systems.  This knowledge is not generally known within the Company or within the industry. He is the only member with this expertise level with the Harmony application and Harish has advanced knowledge and experience in all the modules of Harmony and other supporting applications which cannot be transferred easily with respect to the aggressive timeline and commitments to the customers on the upcoming client customizations and enhancement requests.

2.	There must be a direct correlation between the specialized knowledge gained outside the US and the job duties for the US role. Please explain what training or experience is needed to perform these duties and why this position’s duties require someone with advanced understanding, experience or training in these product(s), research, equipment, techniques, processes or procedures.  

Harish has specialized knowledge on Harmony project and automation technologies Selenium, SoapUI, ATDD, Jenkins. In order to perform his tasks, minimum of 6 months followed by 12 to 18 months of hand on experience on Harmony application and experience on automation technologies. Also the person needs to have good expertise on Health Care domain. The experience and domain knowledge that he possesses on Harmony is unique and no one at onshore has in depth knowledge on this. His understanding of the Harmony workflow is possessed by no one in the U.S. team. He will be required to also support the testing of Harmony Workflow during his tenure in the US which cannot be handled by anyone over there due to insufficient knowledge.

We have upcoming Optum Wallet prod deployments is coming up in March 2019, which requires in-depth Harmony application functional knowledge and its associated backed applications. We also are looking forward to work in the direction of mobile versions of the application which require knowledge of mobile application testing and technologies. One should be expert in healthcare domain and also require knowledge of all the backend systems this application is interfacing with.

The extensive rich Harmony experience and advanced level of knowledge with Harmony applications and Release management process especially in defect triage activities which is gained through years of experience cannot be easily transferred to another individual.

The U.S. based Harmony team consists of Systems/Business Analysts and the Development Manager.  There are no employees in the U.S. who have prior experience with the testing of the Harmony Optum Wallet application. Any other employees associated with the system have only functional knowledge of the system.  Harish will be the only employee in the U.S. who has advanced knowledge of the system. 

Therefore we want to leverage the skills acquired by Harish while working on this project more than 2 years as he has demonstrated high degree of competence in the past, with delivering many projects with high quality. He is well aware of all the changes which the project has undergone in the past, it will be easier for him to understand the business requirements as during the upcoming release portal will be undergoing major changes.

4.	Please explain how your knowledge is more special, more advanced and substantially different than that of others in the industry and other employees within the company. Compare and contrast your duties with others in the industry and in the company.  

All other Harmony team members have less experience with the Harmony suite of applications. Harish has worked on the Harmony application and involved in requirement gathering with business of Harmony suites of application system more than 2 years. During this time, he has gained advanced knowledge of the Harmony specific modules including: Payments, Contributions, Reimbursements, Investments and Backend Systems.  No other team member has this expertise. It would take a significant amount of time and training to reach the level of expertise held by Harish.

His expertise with the Harmony system cannot be transferred without investing substantial effort, time, and money. Someone fresh out of training with no prior experience cannot be expected to have expert level knowledge. If Harish will not be travelling to US for implementation of Optum Wallet and Harmony mobile application for iPad and Tablets, it will be huge loss for organization in terms of revenue generation and market competitiveness.

Being the most experienced and matured member of team, Harish is best suited for this responsibility and will be able to handle this assignment very well. He is having very good technical skill set in required mobile technologies. Along with that he is having expertise in healthcare domain knowledge as well.
